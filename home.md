## What is LPJmL?

The model LPJmL ("Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land") is designed to simulate vegetation composition and distribution as well as stocks and land-atmosphere exchange flows of carbon and water, for both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Using a combination of plant physiological relations, generalized empirically established functions and plant trait parameters, it simulates processes such as photosynthesis, plant growth, maintenance and regeneration losses, fire disturbance, soil moisture, runoff, evapotranspiration, irrigation and vegetation structure.

LPJmL is currently the only DGVM that has dynamic land use fully incorporated at the global scale and also simulates the production of woody and herbaceous short-rotation bioenergy plantations and the terrestrial hydrology. It differs from other models in the wider field by computing carbon, nitorgen and water flows explicitly: most other macro-hydrological models lack the important vegetation structural and physiological responses that influence the water cycle, while most other vegetation models lack the advanced consistent water balance of LPJmL, or are not global in scale.
